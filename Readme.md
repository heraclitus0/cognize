# cognize

**Cognize** is a symbolic simulation engine for modeling misalignment between internal projections and external signals.  
It lets you simulate cognitive drift, rupture events, and adaptive realignment across time.

---

## ✨ Features

- Track projection vs. reality misalignment
- Visualize symbolic rupture, collapse, and realignment
- Inject signal noise, shocks, oscillations, or constants
- Simple API for researchers, developers, and systems thinkers

---

## 🔍 Example Usage

```python
from cognize import run_simulation, plot_trace

trace = run_simulation(
    realign_strength=0.3,
    threshold_base=0.35,
    signal_type="shock",
    steps=100
)
plot_trace(trace)
```

## 🌍 Applications

- AI alignment and hallucination filtering
- Cognitive agent modeling
- Drift detection in simulations
- Behavioral fatigue/collapse simulation
- OSINT and narrative pressure modeling

---

## 📦 Installation

```
pip install cognize
```
