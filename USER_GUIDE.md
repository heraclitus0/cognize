# Cognize: User Guide

## What Is Cognize?

Cognize is a lightweight, programmable epistemic engine for tracking cognitive drift in Python systems. It models how internal beliefs (`V`) diverge from external signals (`R`) over time, maintaining a memory of misalignments (`E`) and determining whether rupture thresholds (`Î˜`) are exceeded. It enables systemsâ€”agents, simulations, or APIsâ€”to introspect, adapt, and realign dynamically.

This guide provides deep insights into how Cognize works, how to use it, and how to extend it.

## Cognition as Control

At its core, Cognize is not just a trackerâ€”it's a **control system for epistemic state regulation**.

- **Projection (`V`)**: What the system *thinks* is true
- **Reality (`R`)**: What the environment *actually* signals
- **Distortion (`âˆ†`)**: The magnitude of divergence between `V` and `R`
- **Threshold (`Î˜`)**: Tolerance level before cognitive rupture occurs
- **Memory (`E`)**: How much past misalignment influences current sensitivity

---

## Installation

```bash
pip install cognize
```

---

## Cognitive Loop Flow

Each time `receive(R)` is called:

1. Compute `âˆ† = |R - V|`
2. Check: `âˆ† > Î˜`?
   - Yes â†’ Rupture: collapse state, log rupture
   - No â†’ Realign: update `V` with a custom function (`âŠ™`)
3. Update misalignment memory `E` based on distortion and decay
4. Log the step, update time

---

## Default Logic

### Rupture
```python
if abs(R - V) > Î˜:
    V, E = 0.0, 0.0
```

### Realignment
```python
V += k * delta * (1 + E)
E += 0.1 * delta
E *= decay_rate
```

---

## Customizing Logic

### Custom Threshold
```python
def threshold_adaptive(E, t):
    return 0.2 + 0.1 * E
```

### Custom Realign (âŠ™ operator)
```python
def realign_tanh(V, delta, E, k):
    return V + k * np.tanh(delta)
```

### Custom Collapse
```python
def collapse_soft_decay(R, V, E):
    return R * 0.1 + V * 0.9, E * 0.5
```

### Injecting
```python
agent.inject_policy(
    threshold=threshold_adaptive,
    realign=realign_tanh,
    collapse=collapse_soft_decay
)
```

---

## Drift Metrics & Symbolic State

### `drift_stats()`
Returns:
- mean drift
- std deviation
- max/min deltas over time

### `summary()`
Returns:
- current V, E, Î˜
- total ruptures
- last event symbol (`rupture` or `realign`)
- identity and UUID

---

## Exporting Logs

### JSON Log
```python
agent.export_json("trace.json")
```

### CSV Log
```python
agent.export_csv("trace.csv")
```

Each step logs: `t`, `V`, `R`, `âˆ†`, `Î˜`, `ruptured`, `event`, `source`

---

## Advanced Usage

### Vector Reality (e.g., embeddings)
```python
import numpy as np
agent.receive(np.array([0.2, 0.4, 0.6]))
```

The vector norm is used for `âˆ†`.

---

### Real-Time Interventions
```python
if agent.should_intervene(margin=0.05):
    agent.intervene_if_ruptured(lambda: trigger_realign())
```

---

### Cognitive Resets
```python
agent.reset()
```

Resets all internal state (`V`, `E`, rupture count, time, logs).

---

### Identity Assignment
```python
EpistemicState(identity={"module": "navigation_core", "agent_id": 17})
```

Stored and shown in `summary()`.

## ðŸ›  Practical Patterns

| Pattern | Use Case |
|--------|----------|
| `decay_rate=0.0` | No memory â€” stateless response |
| High `k` (e.g. 0.9) | Fast realignment |
| Threshold as function of `E` | Memory-sensitized rupture |
| Realign using RMS / L2 logic | Multi-dimensional feedback |

---

## Tips & Design Insights

- **Donâ€™t assume linear adaptation** â€” nonlinear realign functions give smoother or bounded updates.
- **Use logs as audit trails** â€” JSON traces are helpful for debugging LLM drift or simulation cycles.
- **Model decay carefully** â€” high `E` decay makes rupture less sensitive to history.
- **Symbolic abstraction is intentional** â€” Cognize avoids leaking core math; it enables programmable representations.

---

## FAQ

### Is this a filter?
No. Cognize is an epistemic control system, not a signal smoother. It models cognitive drift and intervention logic.

### Does rupture always reset to zero?
Only by default. You can override with soft decay, target-driven resets, or symbolic tagging.

### Can I model memory fatigue?
Yes â€” adjust how `E` decays or write decay rules that increase volatility after repeated misalignments.
