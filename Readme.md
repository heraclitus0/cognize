# Cognize

**Cognize** is a symbolic cognition layer for Python systems.  
It enables any agent, model, or tool to monitor and adapt its internal belief state (`V`)  
in relation to reality (`R`) — with symbolic rupture detection (`⚠`) and memory-based adaptation.

## 🧠 Key Concepts

| Symbol | Meaning |
|--------|---------|
| `V`    | Internal projection / belief |
| `R`    | Received signal / reality |
| `∆`    | Distortion = `|R - V|` |
| `Θ`    | Threshold for rupture |
| `E`    | Misalignment memory |
| `⊙`    | Stable |
| `⚠`    | Ruptured |
| `∅`    | No signal yet |

---

## 🔧 Example

```python
from cognize import EpistemicState

e = EpistemicState()

for r in [0.1, 0.3, 0.8, 1.2, 0.2]:
    e.receive(r)
    print(e.symbol(), e.state())
```

## 🔍 Applications

- Track hallucination risk in LLM agents
- Epistemic wrappers for neural nets, sensors, or control systems
- Rupture-based memory resets in autonomous agents
- Symbolic overlays in simulations or forecasting models
